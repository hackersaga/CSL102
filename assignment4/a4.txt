In this assignment, you will model vectors as lists of floats, and m X n matrices as lists containing m vectors, each of length n. The values will be of type float, so please learn the primitives of type float.


The specifications ofor your matrix package are as follows:


module type MATRIX = sig
type vector
type matrix
val length: vector -> int
val dotprod: vector * vector -> float
val scale: float -> vector -> vector
val scalarMult: float -> matrix -> matrix
val numRows: matrix -> int
val numCols: matrix -> int
val isSquare: matrix -> bool
val transpose: matrix -> matrix
val determinant: matrix -> float
exception NotInvertible
val invert: matrix -> matrix
val add: matrix -> matrix -> matrix
val id: int -> matrix (* creates identity nXn matrix *)
exception NotMultipliable
val multiply: matrix -> matrix -> matrix
end;;
